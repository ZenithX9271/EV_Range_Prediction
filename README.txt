****************************
*EV Range Prediction System*
****************************

A smart and comprehensive Python-based pipeline to predict the *remaining driving range* of an Electric Vehicle (EV) in real-time, using a rich mix of data sources, advanced analytics, and machine learning models.

This project integrates hardware (BMS, TPMS, Arduino), external data sources (weather, road info, elevation), and software techniques (Kalman Filters, Coulomb Counting, GPS/geocoding, ML models) to create a real-world deployable solution for EV drivers.

****************************
*What It Does*
****************************

Given a current location (*real-time GPS* or *user-entered place*) and a destination, the system predicts whether the EV can reach that destination under the current operating conditions, including:

    * State of Charge (SOC)  
    * State of Health (SOH)  
    * Battery temperature  
    * Road and elevation profiles  
    * Weather and wind resistance  
    * Tire pressure (TPMS)  
    * Vehicle specifics (via VIN decoding)  
    * Driving behavior and historical usage data  
    * Regenerative braking insights  

If the predicted range is *less than the route distance*, the system alerts the user to *recharge* before starting. Otherwise, it confirms the route is achievable.

****************************
*Pipeline Overview*
****************************

1. **Input Method**  
   - User can either:
     * Use GPS tracker (real-time coordinates)
     * Enter place names (converted to lat-long using `lat_long.py` via geocoding)

2. **Data Collection Layer**  
   - *Road Info, Elevation Data, Weather Info*  
     → Fetched from multiple APIs and normalized  
   - *Battery Parameters (SOC, SOH, Temp)*  
     → Gathered via BMS modules using Arduino integration  
   - *Tire Pressure*  
     → Accessed using TPMS  
   - *Vehicle Details*  
     → Decoded from VIN  
   - *Driving Profile, Previous Data, Braking Efficiency*  
     → From internal database  

3. **Data Processing Layer**  
   - Raw data is cleaned, standardized, and engineered for model consumption  
   - Kalman Filter and Coulomb Counting algorithms applied for accurate SOC/SOH estimation

4. **Prediction Layer**  
   - ML model (trained on historical and simulation data) is used to estimate the EV's range  
   - Model is validated via testing to ensure accuracy and generalization

5. **Decision Output**  
   - If *predicted range ≥ route distance* → Proceed  
   - If *predicted range < route distance* → Warning: Charging needed
